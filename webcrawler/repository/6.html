Her then-husband, Colin, was a fisherman; he'd bring home mackerel, crayfish, lobster, crab and salmon. Some of the catch would feed them and their two children; whatever remained, Barnes preserved to sell or barter with neighbours in exchange for potatoes and seasonal gluts. Life in Ireland's coastal villages was hard, and these communities sustained each other by sharing food.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last year Colin fished for salmon at sea, in 1979, he didn't get paid.

Unlike hot smoking, which cooks the fish and results in a product with a short shelf life, cold smoking is more akin to dehydration, extending shelf life for months. Wood is set to smoke at a low temperature away from a chamber where salt-cured fish is hung. Smoke travels along a pipe into the chamber, gently enveloping the wild fish in a preserving vapour of smoke, forcing out moisture and preserving flavour. Cold-smoking fish is a labour-intensive process, from the preparation of the fillets to salt curing and smoking. It results in a food of high skill, high regard and high value, and is an ideal income generator for fisher-families during leaner winter months when harsh weather frequently rolls in off the Atlantic Ocean forcing small fishing boats to tie up and wait it out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"infographic","imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","pullQuoteImageAlignment":"centre","videoImageAlign":"centre","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220629-the-last-of-irelands-rare-wild-salmon-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0chp9q6"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"portrait","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220629-the-last-of-irelands-rare-wild-salmon-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EOver time, Barnes' Irish Wild Smoked Salmon drew acclaim by chefs and caught the eye of food award judges.

Another account holds that in 1611, Ryukyuan King Sho Nei sent a gift of sweet potatoes to Satsuma Domain, a powerful political entity in southern Kyushu, which had invaded his kingdom and taken over his land &ndash; one result of which is that the orange tubers sometimes still bear the name \u003Cem\u003Esatsuma-imo\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (potato from Satsuma).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of their path to get there, over time, roasted sweet potatoes proved very popular in Japan.

But in 1942, the wartime Staple Food Control Act rationed the sale of various foods, including rice and sweet potatoes, and many sweet potato shops were closed. Nevertheless, they became a key staple during World War Two, when crops like wheat and barley were even scarcer. \"Sweet potato flour was used as a substitute for wheat flour,\" Rath explained. \"From 1944, public lands were converted into potato patches, and sweet potatoes would replace the meagre rice allotments in public rations by 1945.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing a post-war revision to the Staple Food Control Act, which released sweet potatoes from government regulation, vendors returned to the streets.

In the 19th Century, the Chinese diaspora brought over Teochew and Hokkien people from Guangdong and Fujian provinces on China&rsquo;s south-eastern coast. During that same time, Penang grew under British rule and it became a bustling entrepot providing greater employment opportunites. The Hokkien people came to work in the rubber plantations and as traders and merchants, while the Teochew found jobs in the tin mines and as fisherman. With them came some of their kitchen staples like soy sauce, bean curd and noodles called \u003Cem\u003Ekway teow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Hokkien, the word char means &ldquo;stir-fried&rdquo;\u003Cem\u003E,\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and kway teow means &ldquo;rice cake strips&rdquo;, referring to the noodles. What had begun in China&rsquo;s south-eastern provinces as a simple noodle dish with pork, fish sauce and soy sauce was transformed into a seafood delight once it hit the island&rsquo;s shores. Initially, it was sold at night by fisherman and cockle gatherers trying to make an extra buck. Instead of the traditional ingredients, they used what was plentiful to create a revised version of the dish. It was a poor man&rsquo;s food and the other Chinese immigrants devoured it as something fast, cheap and tasty to sustain them for hours under the hot sun. The dish became a labourer&rsquo;s staple.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;When the waves of Teochew and Hokkien immigrants came from China, they came alone, leaving their wives and families behind.

Over time, the climate has had warming periods, expanding the range of tropical areas north and, by extension, the pawpaw.

In 1786, when Thomas Jefferson was minister to France, he had pawpaw seeds and plants shipped from Virginia to friends in Europe.

In the southern hemisphere, whether you&rsquo;re in Tasmania, New Zealand or even parts of southern Victoria, you&rsquo;ve got a real possibility of seeing an aurora in mild summer weather, although you&rsquo;ll have to stay up later as it doesn&rsquo;t get dark until 21:00 or 22:00.

Rice farming flourished in this region, and Jollof began life as a dish called \u003Cem\u003Ethieboudienne\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, prepared with rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.

In Nigeria and Cameroon, red peppers are often blended with the base ingredients of onions, tomatoes and chilli to add vibrancy and a subtle sweetness.

They think of its cultivation as a 300-year-old art passed down through generations, and they consider the hospitality around it as a time-honoured tradition that strengthens social bonds across the remote valleys.
