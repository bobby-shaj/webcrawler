Back in 2012, Knell decided to take a closer look at the problem. He was particularly interested in studying the eccentric features that closely resemble the mating displays of living animals, or those that have defied other forms of explanation. These include the facial horns and frills of triceratops and its relatives &ndash; such as the psittacosaurus, which has unusual sideways spikes on both its cheeks &ndash; the head crests of predators like Dilophosaurus, which has two prominent ridges above each eye, the long necks of giants like Diplodocus, and the feathers in the ancestors of birds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThough there is no definitive way to determine what these weird anatomical flourishes were used for, Knell &ndash; together with an international team of scientists &ndash; quickly realised there are some strong hints in living animals, if you know where to look.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne is sexual dimorphism &ndash; where the males and females of a species look different. It's rare for the two sexes to have totally different lifestyles and strategies for survival, so when they've got different features they're usually so that the males can directly attract females (such as male peacocks' colourful cloaks of feathers) or compete against each other for the right to mate (such as the horns of stags).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately this particular hint is not that useful for understanding dinosaurs, since scientists can't yet tell the males and females apart &ndash; even when they do discover discrepancies between fossilised individuals, they have no way of knowing whether they're looking at different sexes, or different species.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this brings us to the next tell-tale sign. When a feature only appears in mature adults, and not in the babies or juveniles, it's often for sex &ndash; like the manes on male lions, which are thought to signal their eligibility. However, this one can also be tricky.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBack in 1942, scientists unearthed a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Frepository.si.edu\u002Fbitstream\u002Fhandle\u002F10088\u002F22800\u002FSMC_106_Gilmore_1946_13_1-19.pdf\"\u003Estriking new skull in Montana\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, in the US.

We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period. Factors such as how many images a page has and the length of the story can make a big difference in the energy required to load the page, and how long the reader spends on the page.

The carbon intensity of the energy grid varies between countries. The calculation assumed the average intensity as reported by the International Energy Agency (475g CO2-equivalent per kWh). But in reality, this will vary based on where readers are in the world.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFuture Planet does not reside on any single server, and the BBC has servers in multiple datacentres. The BBC also uses Content Delivery Networks, third-party networks of servers that reduce the load on our own. The calculation doesn&rsquo;t take account of this, which slightly inflates the estimate as CDNs are more efficient.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cumulative uncertainty from these factors is the reason we show the digital component of emissions as a range, rather than a single figure.

Similarly, we can&rsquo;t yet measure for a given click exactly how much carbon is released from the transfer of that exact data over the internet, the energy to run those specific servers at any instant, or which type of device a reader is using when they make that click.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other factors that some might argue should be counted in a story&rsquo;s carbon emissions, too. What about the BBC staff who work on Future Planet, some full-time but many sporadically among other obligations &ndash; do we count, for example, the energy used to heat and power the office? If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet? Or you could take it even further: if a journalist ate a sandwich while on location reporting for us, do we count the carbon footprint of the food &ndash; or not, since they&rsquo;d likely have to eat regardless of whether they were on assignment?
