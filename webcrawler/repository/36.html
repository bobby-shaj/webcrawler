If we can read the scrolls, we might get one step closer to what the great philosophers actually wrote. \"I think the odds are fairly high that we could get something new, possibly even something we've never heard of before,\" he adds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile some of these research efforts are able to tell us what still exists but is hidden, others hope to infer what has been lost.

Before it was sliced up, the complete work was, luckily, copied by another artist Gerrit Lundens.

Presley's frustrations are sated by his bank balance, even as he famously puts on weight, and his star begins to wane.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biopic veers away from delving into Elvis's relationship with Priscilla Presley, focussing on his career and, interestingly, his relationship with the black community. Elvis was born impoverished, and grew up in the mostly black neighbourhood of Tupelo, Mississippi. He grew up around black people, and by the time he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, he was such a big fan of black music that he covered the songs he heard. He was friends with the blues singer songwriter BB King, played in the film by Kelvin Harrison Jr.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin this framework, the film claims that Elvis was instrumental in helping black people get equal rights in the US. It does this through Parker's narration, who acts as a mouthpiece for an idea formulated by Michael T Bertrand in his book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.press.uillinois.edu\u002Fbooks\u002F?id=p072703\"\u003ERace, Rock and Elvis\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Bertrand contends that by singing songs hitherto attributed to black musicians, Elvis helped white southerners rethink their attitude to race, leading to an unacknowledged (well, at least until Luhrmann's film) impetus for white people to support the civil rights movement.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Elvis represented a generation that came up at a time when there was a lot of change going on in the South,\" Bertrand, who is also a professor of history at Tennessee State University, tells BBC Culture. \"One of the changes was to do with the evolution of black radio programming, and in the late 1940s teenagers like Elvis were tuning in [which gave them] a different type of perspective concerning race within a segregated society. As Elvis gets older, he has an appreciation of African-American culture and was drawn to black music in a way his grandparents would not have been. As he became popular, Elvis showed that it was 'okay' [for white people] to appreciate black culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Elvis and his peers in the South are the first white kids consuming rhythm and blues. That's a breakthrough, and there were huge ramifications in that,\" adds the author. In his view, rock 'n' roll and Elvis \"introduced a larger audience and a larger group of people to a culture that had been behind the veil of segregation. It opened up society in a positive way\".\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EElvis's contribution was through his actions rather than any big public statement, Bertrand believes. \"I don't think Elvis was political in the sense that he would go on marches and things like that. These musicians were worried about their careers first and did not make political statements. They made their statements with their choice of music. In the context of the segregation they lived under, that was a major statement. In the 50s, many rhythm and blues artists said they were happy Elvis opened doors because the music became accessible. The problem was that because he was white, he had accessibility to venues that some of his colleagues and contemporaries did not.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220624-who-was-the-real-elvis-presley-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0cgrcl7"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"Elvis still","imageOrientation":"portrait","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220624-who-was-the-real-elvis-presley-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EBut equally, other commentators have seen Elvis as a problematic figure regarding race, with accusations that he has appropriated black music, and some even going so far to state that he's a racist.&nbsp;An infamous and damning comment about Elvis regarding race can be found in Public Enemy's Fight the Power, a song written for Spike Lee's seminal film, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.imdb.com\u002Ftitle\u002Ftt0097216\u002F\"\u003EDo the Right Thing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, in 1989.&nbsp;It contains the rap, \"Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant shit to me.

The likes of Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, and Apocalypse Now ended with at least an inkling of hope, reflection, or realisation.

But certain contemporary reviews made note of the book's jocular tone: Charles J Rolo \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theatlantic.com\u002Fmagazine\u002Farchive\u002F1958\u002F09\u002Flolita-by-vladimir-nabokov\u002F304639\u002F\"\u003Edeemed it\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \"one of the funniest serious novels I have ever read\" that \"parodies everything it touches\" with its \"charge of comic genius\".

Fifty-three-year-old British actor James Mason &ndash; who was known on both sides of the Atlantic for roles in Odd Man Out, A Star is Born and North by Northwest &ndash; was cast in the central role, playing the part with a sense of ruffled debonair charm that invited pity rather than disgust. Indeed, Mason's Humbert is not the man we are introduced to in the book's foreword, where the fictional John Ray Jr, describes Humbert as \"horrible, he is abject, he is a shining example of moral leprosy\". What's more, Kubrick and Nabokov's script entirely removes the \"explanation\" Humbert gives for his sexual obsession: that, one summer as a young boy, he was interrupted during a sexual encounter with his 14-year-old love, who then died. Instead his Lolita, real name Dolores, is depicted simply as a girl that has transfixed and enamoured him; there is no hint of prior paedophilia, or, as the book says, \"diabolical cunning\".\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA bag of contradictions\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make a releasable film, Kubrick and Harris were tasked with hiring an actress for the role of Dolores Haze who looked older than the girl Nabokov had described in the novel as a \"monkeyish\" 12-year-old who was \"unconscious herself of her fantastic power\". Of 800 auditionees, a model and TV actress from Davenport, Iowa was chosen: Sue Lyon. Sophisticated, sunny, and &ndash; crucially &ndash; appearing far older than her 14 years, she flew to the UK for the film's lengthy shoot. Some years later in 1969, Kubrick \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.visual-memory.co.uk\u002Famk\u002Fdoc\u002F0069.html\"\u003Eadmitted\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to bowing to \"the pressure over the Production Code and the Catholic Legion of Decency at the time,\" of which the casting of the older-looking Lyon was a significant part.

She looks imperious, knowing, and appears to be at least 18; she is not, as Nabokov describes in the book, \"standing four feet ten in one sock\".

It is with Quilty that Dolores eventually decides to run away, orchestrating her escape from Humbert by having the other man pose as her uncle to discharge her from hospital where she is staying with a phony illness. Kubrick expanded significantly the role of Quilty, an avant-garde playwright who is directing a play at Dolores's school; the film opens with his murder, which occurs at the book's close, after Sellers has immediately set up the film's comic tone by popping out from behind a chair and declaring \"no, I'm Spartacus!\" in reference to Kubrick's last feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220617-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-lolita-story-60-years-on-6"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0cff3kt"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"Lolita still","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220617-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-lolita-story-60-years-on-7"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EInstead of fulfilling the novel's expectation of his role as the manifestation of Humbert's guilt or his tragic foil, instead Sellers displays his comic timing and predilection for skits.

Dining chairs, for example. Maybe a nice set of curtains. When the barrister Cecil Chubb attended an auction in Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1915, his sights were set on something domestic. But in that feverish atmosphere of the auction house &ndash; a place where it's easy to get swept up in the thrill of bidding and fear of losing out on something one of a kind &ndash; he made an unexpected purchase. He bought Stonehenge for &pound;6,600 (about &pound;680,000 by today's value). It happened, he said, \"on a whim\". Chubb, who was the last private owner of Stonehenge, only laid claim to the site for three years. In 1918 he passed the stones into public ownership, where they have remained ever since under the care of English Heritage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore like this:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E - \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fculture\u002Farticle\u002F20220518-how-fear-sex-and-power-shaped-ancient-mythology\"\u003EHow fear shaped ancient mythology\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E - \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fculture\u002Farticle\u002F20220318-the-ancient-enigma-that-still-resonates-today\"\u003EThe ancient enigma that still resonates\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E - \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fculture\u002Farticle\u002F20211102-why-the-secret-symbols-of-magic-and-witchcraft-fascinate-us\"\u003EWhy magic's secret symbols fascinate us\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt 4,500 years ago, Stonehenge is one of the most famous prehistoric monuments in the world.

It is instantly recognisable: the hulking sarsens, the improbable lintels.

From archaeologists to druids, historians to poets, ardent pilgrims to the occasional impulse buyer, its mysterious origins and powerful material presence have captivated people not just for centuries, but millennia. It is a place that immediately poses questions. Where are the stones from? (The short answer: the smaller ones, known as bluestones, are from Preseli in South-West Wales, 220 miles away, while the larger ones originate from Marlborough Downs, which is 20 miles from Stonehenge.) How were they transported and arranged? (Extraordinary human effort, potentially \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.britishmuseum.org\u002Fhow-was-stonehenge-built\u002F\"\u003Einvolving\u003C\u002Fa\u003E land, sea, sledges, wooden tracks and jointed timbers.) What was the purpose of it all?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis last question remains the most open-ended. It is one that the British Museum's current exhibition \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.britishmuseum.org\u002Fexhibitions\u002Fworld-stonehenge\"\u003EThe World of Stonehenge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E seeks, at least in part, to answer. By taking a comprehensive look at the artefacts created and materials used by the people from the Neolithic era through to the Bronze Age, the exhibition seeks to unravel the complex meaning of these standing stones. Across the course of the show, Stonehenge figures as many things: a stake claimed to the land, a space for community and ritual, a burial site, art on a vast scale, a monument with great cosmological significance, a magnetic draw for visitors from afar. The show argues for Stonehenge as a place of shifting significance, added to over time and reflecting the extraordinary transformation brought about by the technological transition from stone to metalworking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"There's something about the way Stonehenge has come to crystallise or symbolise a sense of the deep past,\" lead curator Neil Wilkin explains, when asked about why the site continues to exert such a hold on us today. This is a past before written records, before easy documentation, a past that marries \"the natural and historical\" with the speculatively ceremonial and spiritual. The exhibition compares Stonehenge with several other stone circles, as well as Seahenge: a timber circle with a tree stump at its heart built in 2049BC on a Norfolk saltmarsh, which was rediscovered in 1998. Excavated to preserve it from the elements, the timbers are currently on show in the British Museum, ancient wood standing to attention in the gloom.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe power of a stone circle\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough megalithic stone circles appear in other locations including France, they are mostly concentrated in the UK (recent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fuk-news\u002F2022\u002Fmay\u002F04\u002Fstonehenge-exhibition-explores-parallels-with-japanese-stone-circles\"\u003Enews\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has focused on Stonehenge's parallels with elaborate pebble circles in Japan). \"The henge monument, which is a ditch and bank, those monuments are exclusive to Britain and Ireland, which is a very curious thing &ndash; and difficult to explain,\" Wilkin says.

From the stark lines of Stonehenge to the lumpen sprawl of nearby Avebury, via the many circles scattered up and down Britain and Ireland, from Cornwall to Cork to Orkney to Shropshire, what these places symbolise goes far beyond a mere memento of the past. Many of these smaller monuments come with their own complex stories: of witches, of magical properties, of secret rituals, of metamorphosed bodies and ley lines and between spaces where the veil separating our present world from other times and places grows thin. Our lack of definitive knowledge over how these circles were originally used only heightens the drama. Imagination rushes in to fill the hollows, age-old explanations for these strange structures solidified into a history that blurs the factual and folkloric. \"I think we quite like to play with that idea of drifting between magic and reality,\" Macbeth adds. \"Creating experiences that do feel slightly otherworldly, but then bringing [it] back down to the earth and to the stone.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERitual and time travel\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA stone circle is a useful dramatic device. It is visually striking. Often eerily so. There's a reason why so many stories involving stone circles focus on the idea of people turned to rock. The stones stand, gathered like figures. Tracing some of the lumps and clefts in the sarsens at Avebury, for example, it's easy to find yourself searching for faces. Although such circles are built from the natural world and speak to its rhythms &ndash; its seasons, its solstices &ndash; they also exist in opposition to the landscape. Their appearance is surreal, sometimes foreboding. Without beginning or end, they suggest all manner of strange possibilities enclosed within their compass.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0cf1p3w"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003ECertain genres of work have made particularly effective use of the stone circle. Folk horror, with its revelations of dark and savage things lurking beneath the bucolic rural surface, is especially apt territory. In cult classic movie The Wicker Man (1973), which is set on a remote Scottish island, a circle complete with Stonehenge-style lintels forms the backdrop for naked frolicking and ominous processions. A relic from a pre-Christian world, the stone circle is a ripe reminder of older, pagan beliefs. Though such theories are no longer given much credence, the image of ritual sacrifice still lingers: stones reimagined as alters. In the tragic denouement of Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Tess's final resting place before she is arrested and executed is \"an oblong slab\" at Stonehenge. \"Did they sacrifice to God here?\" she asks her unhappy husband Angel Clare before she falls asleep. \"No,\" he answers. \"I believe to the Sun.\" There she dreams peacefully for a short while, a sacrifice herself to the unwavering cruelties of Victorian misogyny and morality.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-6"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"It's the same fantasy that makes us hope for snowy forests at the back of the wardrobe or a Wonderland down a rabbit hole: a promise of unexpected escape","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-7"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EFantasy also frequently features stone circles as portals or sites of supernatural concentration. Take the hugely successful book-turned-TV series Outlander, with its fictive Craigh Na Dun stones that plunge protagonist Claire Randall &ndash; a World War Two-era nurse &ndash; into 18th-Century Scotland. The stones are a porous place, allowing movement through time for those blessed or cursed enough to tap into their powers at charged times of the year (the TV pilot takes place over Samhain, the Celtic festival we have since replaced with Halloween). There are plenty of precedents for this, including Five Children and It author E Nesbit's story Accidental Magic (1912), which imagines its protagonist Quentin falling asleep on the altar-stone at Stonehenge, and waking up in Atlantis. It's the same fantasy that makes us hope for snowy forests at the back of the wardrobe or a Wonderland down a rabbit hole: a promise of unexpected escape, a mundane doorway to another world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChildren's literature is especially attuned to the bends and loops of chronology and geography. Penelope Lively's The Whispering Knights (1971), Susan Cooper's Over Sea, Under Stone (1965), and Alan Garner's The Weirdstone of Brisingamen (1960) all feature stony settings that blend past, present and distant myth. Arthurian Knights and evil enchantresses are awoken from slumber. The contemporary world is threatened by long dormant evils.

Filmed in Avebury, it follows the misadventures of an astrophysicist and his son who move to the village of Milbury. There they encounter an oddly happy, vacant population, and eventually uncover a complicated secret involving ancient pagan rituals, black holes, brainwashing and a time rift that brings the world to the brink of destruction again and again. The stones themselves are natural magnets, focusing and amplifying negative energy. Their power proves nearly impossible to escape.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is something to be said for the post-War boom in artwork and entertainment featuring stone circles. In his essay The Edge of the Ceiling, Alan Garner writes about the profound effect of World War Two on his childhood and later artistic sensibilities: \"Daily life was lived on a mythic plane: of absolute Good against absolute Evil; of the need to endure, to survive whatever had to be overcome.\" Stone circles are themselves a sort of mythic plane: a symbol of endurance, as well as a handy setting for vast, existential battles between Good and Evil. But in reaching back into the deep past, to a place where kings and monsters co-exist, they also sidestep the horrors of more recent events. They offer not just the threat of history repeating itself, but also the opportunity to redeem the world once more. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe properties of stone \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat so many of these books, films and shows tap into is the idea of stone as a vessel. In these works, stone becomes something that can hold not just magic or energy &ndash; talismans on a vast scale &ndash; but time itself. There is an immediate truth to this. Strip away the fantastical parts, and what you have is an accurate reflection of a material that carries its history in its make-up. Wandering around the Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum, it is clear how much one can glean from stone. It's not just about how it is shaped, whether as a sculpture or a spearhead, but what it betrays of itself: its mineral content, its age, its precise geographical origins. It's how we now know that those who built Stonehenge found a way to transport those Welsh bluestones more than 200 miles to the Wiltshire countryside. We just had to learn to read the evidence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-10"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0cf1nxy"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220615-stonehenge-and-the-eerie-allure-of-ancient-stone-circles-11"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EThe properties of stone have always been important. \"It's not enough, in some ways, to just call it stone, because it's clear that the different qualities and different sources were really meaningful,\" Wilkin explains, saying that working on the exhibition has given him a much deeper appreciation for the ways in which stone has been used and understood over millennia. \"People really did value the stories or the mythologies that might have been bound up in the sources of stones and their properties.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are surrounded every day by history. From our trees to our cities, our language to our very atoms, we live in a present tense formed from the building blocks of the past.

Still, there is darkly funny significance in the scene where Chris, aspiring writer and burgeoning serial killer, bludgeons a Barbour-clad tourist to death with a rock in a National Trust stone circle in retribution for being told to clean up after his (freshly stolen) dog.

I've got a piece where I wrap Rodin's The Kiss up in string. They own The Kiss, and they'll allow me to re-enact my work.\" Re-enactment is a crucial aspect of Parker's imagination and art, which often ropes our eyes into seeing familiar objects as if for the first time. In 2003 she intervened in French sculptor Auguste Rodin's iconic marble depiction of adulterous lovers from Dante's Inferno &ndash; among the Tate's many treasures &ndash; by wrapping the famous marble canoodle in a mile of string, and wryly rechristening it The Distance (A Kiss with String Attached).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrough fresh eyes\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with all of Parker's work, there is something much more at play than meets the eye in her ephemeral defacement of Rodin's masterpiece.

But Parker isn't merely rehearsing an impish prank that made engaging with works almost impossible. By cocooning the cold and chiselled clinch of Dante's lovers, Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini, Parker reinvents Rodin's sculpture. Simultaneously obscuring and accentuating the contours of Rodin's work, the alternating slackness and tautness of the spooling string forces our eyes to unravel the profundity of a cultural touchstone that we have looked at so many times we no longer really see it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220621-cornelia-parker-the-artist-who-likes-to-blow-things-up-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"Far from purely conceptual, Parker's work is devastatingly physical – a physicality she leverages through formidable force into something more deeply psychological and emotional","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220621-cornelia-parker-the-artist-who-likes-to-blow-things-up-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003ELike Marcel Duchamp before her, who notoriously tipped an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fculture\u002Farticle\u002F20170410-the-urinal-that-changed-how-we-think\"\u003Eunused urinal\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on its side in 1917, signed the ceramic with the nom de plume \"R.

Where Duchamp's seminal notion of the \"readymade\" depends on minimal intercession by the artist, Parker's art invariably manifests the effects of extreme and strenuous disruption. Far from purely conceptual, her work is devastatingly physical &ndash; a physicality she leverages through formidable force into something more deeply psychological and emotional.

From its very inception, art is wreckage resurrected. We know now that the earliest Stone Age artists incinerated shattered animal skeletons and pulverised the carbonised fragments to produce a radiant black pigment that they used to sketch the static stampede of bison on cave walls.

The flattened teapots and trombones, baby spoons and cigarette cases had been gathered from car boot sales, markets, and the second-hand stall that she helped run at Portobello market in London.

That fortuitous friction between weighty disfigurement of \"ruined objects\" and the weightless ballet of shadows, serendipitously cast, is something Parker would endeavour to control more concertedly in subsequent works. \"I like shadows and things that are shiny, the opposite of shadows,\" she tells BBC Culture. \"I've always liked nocturnes.

It's difficult not to detect a grim smirk behind her slashed torso of a doll of Oliver Twist that she sliced in two with the blade that once slipped through the guillotine that cut things short for Marie Antoinette in 1793 &ndash; a prop Parker borrowed from Madame Tussauds.

Summoning the force of an industrial press 25 times stronger than the steamroller she'd used 15 years earlier, and a forklift truck, Parker crushed 60 tubas, trumpets, coronets and a hulking sousaphone into breathless skins that she arranged like flattened asteroids orbiting around a dangling lamp. \"The squashed instruments,\" Parker tells BBC Culture, \"were hung in a ring, in a circle like a marching band. I quite liked the instruments becoming shadows because it means the audience is between the shadows and the objects. You can't tell the objects are squished in the shadows. It's like a ghost band, as it were. The idea of a Perpetual Canon that just keeps going on forever. It's like these wind instruments have inhaled and never exhaled.

It's like magnifying everything.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Magnifying everything\" is what Parker does best. Her robust interventions into the lives of objects and her determination to squeeze meaning from the props of existence, never results in a diminishment of an object's power, only an intensification. By pounding the wind out of things, she manages paradoxically to essentialise its breath. And it's a trick she continues to pull off with fresh flair to this day, creating a new installation for the exhibition, Island (2022), that's the final work in Tate's show.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe curiously eclectic piece, which occupies a gallery of its own, is comprised of a greenhouse whose windows have been smudged with strokes of chalk from the White Cliffs of Dover (a recurring material in her work). Strobing in time to the rhythm of one's lungs, a light inside the greenhouse gives intermittent glimpses of the structure's floor, made from discarded tiles designed by Augustus Pugin for the Houses of Parliament in the 19th Century. \"It looks a bit like a floating carpet,\" says Parker. \"All the most powerful people in the world have strode across them &ndash; Gladstone, everyone. It's been worn thin by politicians.

Leo showers Nancy with tenderness, even when she offers him the opposite in return. The former teacher pokes and prods at the dynamics of his job, enquiring if he ever feels degraded or what could have gone so terribly wrong for him to choose that specific career.

For a long time, film has done the very opposite, feeding into patterns of preconceptions that are not only inaccurate, but arguably dangerous. Most popular accounts of sex work fall under two contrasting detrimental categories: \"the disposable sex worker\" or \"the hooker with a heart of gold\". The first encompasses the films in which sex workers are ruthlessly (and often brutally) murdered, their death handled as nothing more than a work hazard. Think Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (1999), where high-end escort Mandy (Julienne Davis) is introduced mid-overdose, briefly seen again masked and half-naked, then &ndash; finally &ndash; at the morgue.&nbsp; \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThrillers notoriously foster this trope, with films such as David Fincher's Se7en (1995) and Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives (2013) both featuring shockingly vicious murders of sex workers. True crime adaptations are another fruitful genre for the perpetuation of this violent pattern, with titles such as The Frozen Ground (2013), Lost Girls (2020) and Green River Killer (2005) dwelling &ndash; often with gratuitous violence &ndash; on the killing of sex workers and the disregard commonly shown by authorities in solving such cases.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven the most celebrated film about a \"hooker with a heart of gold\" begins by reinforcing the notion of the disposable sex worker. The aforementioned Pretty Woman features a dead street worker in one of its very first scenes. \"She be out on these streets day in, day out, trading her sorry self for some crack\", says a man to the journalists gathering nearby, implying the young woman was to blame for her own death. As the dead body lays in a skip, tourists snap pictures, desensitised to this very specific type of violence. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220616-the-films-showing-sex-workers-in-a-new-light-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0cfb74y"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"Pretty Woman","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"culture\u002Farticle\u002F20220616-the-films-showing-sex-workers-in-a-new-light-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EPretty Woman helped bring conversations about sex work to the mainstream, but has been widely criticised in its approach to the subject. Vivian's trajectory is constructed with the single goal of having the audience root for her to ultimately abandon sex work &ndash; any other outcome would be deemed tragic. The way out, of course, is presented in the form of Edward, a rich, white, older man who is unable to resist the urge to rescue her. \"You could be so much more,\" he tells Vivian as the two lay in bed, the faint lights failing to obscure the fact he perceives her as &ldquo;lesser than&rdquo;.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe film also fosters the idea that this transactional relationship is a romantic one, which, in turn, romanticises the idea of sex work itself.

Some films take it up a notch by adopting these harmful stereotypes in their titles, such as Dead Hooker in a Trunk (2019) and Death of a Hooker (1971), also known as Who Killed Mary What's 'Er Name?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReframing sex work\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany recent films, however, are actively challenging these stereotypes, with one example being 2018's CAM, written and produced by Mazzei. The story, which employs horror to explore the loss of agency frequently experienced by sex workers who perform online, debates important matters such as consent and the separation between person and persona. \"It was absolutely mandatory for us to include sex workers in every step of the filmmaking process. I can't speak for all sex workers, I'm just one. So it was important to include other voices and make sure that we had arrangements about how things were portrayed,\" says Mazzei, who is also the author of Camgirl, a candid memoir about her days of live-stream camming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Mazzei emphasises the importance of employing sex workers in all steps of the creative process, she admits it is still far from easy for current or former sex workers to be open about their past within the industry. \"It was a terrifying experience coming out as a sex worker in Hollywood and taking meetings with people who didn't always respect me as a writer and people who just wanted to ask salacious questions about camming\", Mazzei says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sentiment is shared by Numa Perrier, whose directorial debut Jezebel (2019) is adapted from her time as a camgirl in the late 1990s. \"There is a long-lasting stigma around any type of sex work, and that was a big part of why I was afraid to talk about my personal story at first. I have, however, quickly realised through workshopping the script that it was a bigger creative challenge to hide behind a story that was mine.

Sam Weir is founder of Lotte.V1, a one-on-one styling service, aimed at rekindling our relationship to our clothing. \"Many of us don't use what we own because we've been taught to find style solutions through consumption,\" says the stylist, with a long track record in high-profile campaigns. \"Styling allows people to express themselves and have fun with clothing, without buying new; to push creativity and to truly wear their clothing.

Professional organiser Katrina Hassan uses the KonMari Method of tidying. \"Awareness and positive habit change is at the heart of the process,\" she says. \"And a key principle is to store things so that you can see everything easily. When you know exactly what you own, you're far more likely to take care of it.\" Periodic assessments allow you to connect with your items and assess their quality over and over again.
