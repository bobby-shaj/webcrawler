This has fed the narrative that it&rsquo;s more acceptable for men to leave home if they&rsquo;re contributing financially, whereas women are seen to be abandoning their domestic duties. &ldquo;Fathers are more likely to just perceive [paid] market work as &lsquo;work&rsquo;.

You can work full-time, parent full-time and everything will look like it does in the shiny images of perfect nurseries and smiling babies you see on social media.

While every job has its stressors, taking that step to match a role to your particular priorities can pay off. &ldquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m not selling my soul &ndash; I&rsquo;m actually repositioning myself so I can have a better life&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Lechner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Molly&rsquo;s case, prioritising comfort and wellbeing over passion in her employment has been rather freeing. &ldquo;One of the pros is since you don&rsquo;t care about that industry, you&rsquo;re not going to take it home with you. It&rsquo;s very easy for me to let go, and let things roll off of me,&rdquo; she explains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd for workers later in their careers, the money and stability that comes with swapping passion for a less inspiring role may be less about &lsquo;going to the dark side&rsquo;, and rather just a case of pragmatism. Workers might have kids, want to buy a house or review their pension and realise, quite simply, that they need to earn more.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Reality can hit you with a brisk wind,&rdquo; says Lechner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to pursue beautiful ideals when one is a relatively agent, and a whole different game to continue with that pursuit when you a have a couple of little ones needing to be fed.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese days, the experts suggest, judging a former colleague for &lsquo;selling out&rsquo; is unwarranted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for judgmental views ever, and surely not when one is taking care of their needs and commitments, financial and any other,&rdquo; says Lechner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince moving jobs, Molly hasn&rsquo;t looked back. &ldquo;The energy [at the new job] is much more positive &ndash; it&rsquo;s not bleak.

From these initial responses, the team created lists of 45 personal characteristics, 28 occupations and 19 hobbies. The researchers then asked a further group of more than 300 people to rate each one on a scale of one (not boring at all) to seven (extremely boring).&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese results were, in themselves, highly revealing. According to Van Tilburg&rsquo;s participants, data-entry workers, accountants and tax officers were considered to be the most boring professionals. Hobbies seen as boring included going to church, watching TV and sleeping. In terms of personality, bores were thought to be closed-minded with a narrow range of interests, and to lack a sense of humour or strong opinions on any issue. They were also thought to be overly negative complainers, whinging about every issue.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team next wanted to understand the consequences of these stereotypes &ndash; including their potential to create social isolation. To do so, they created a series of vignettes based on the features investigated in the previous studies. &nbsp;One was a description of &ldquo;Brian&rdquo;, for example, who was a data-entry worker at an accountancy company whose main hobby was watching TV &ndash; a portrait that perfectly matched the boring stereotype. This was a contrast to &ldquo;Paul&rdquo;, an artist from a local newspaper who enjoyed running, gardening and reading, whose combination of personal details were generally considered much less boring.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team then questioned participants about how much they thought they would like each character and whether they would actively try to avoid meeting or talking to them. The participants were even asked how much money they would have to be paid to spend up to a week of their life with that person.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you might expect, the fictional characters who filled the criteria of the boring stereotype were not treated kindly. In general, people were much less likely to want to meet Brian than Paul. And to put up with that tedium over prolonged periods of time, the participants reported needing nearly \u003Cem\u003Ethree times\u003C\u002Fem\u003E as much money. &ldquo;They really sought compensation for hanging around with these people, and that suggests that there's some sort of psychological cost to it,&rdquo; says Van Tilburg.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider the studies showing that people would rather experience pain than boredom, it makes sense that you&rsquo;d need some reward to offset the discomfort and to make up for all the other, more exciting experiences, that you might be missing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"worklife\u002Farticle\u002F20220422-why-we-snap-judge-some-people-as-boring-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"A man doing gardening","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"worklife\u002Farticle\u002F20220422-why-we-snap-judge-some-people-as-boring-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to be interesting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could all learn from this research. Your knee-jerk assumption that people of certain professions or hobbies are inherently boring could prevent you from forging deep and meaningful connections.

Fortunately, he has some tips that might help the world&rsquo;s Brians to avoid an unkind judgement.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis first is to consider whether you can reframe your job description. Data analysis might, at first glance, be seen as a boring profession &ndash; but perhaps you are contributing to a bigger endeavour, such as scientific research. In general, scientists were thought to be much less boring than data workers &ndash; so emphasising the scientific element of your job could help to bypass people&rsquo;s biases.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that&rsquo;s not possible, you can open up about your private life. Remember that bores, in general, were considered to be closed-minded with few passions. Almost everyone enjoys TV, after all, and if you list that as your only hobby you are inevitably going to seem bland. But what are your more individual obsessions? Things like gardening, journaling, fishing and knitting were all viewed relatively positively. And the more examples you give, the greater the chance that you&rsquo;ll find common ground with the other person. &ldquo;I think it's important to showcase the range of activities,&rdquo; Van Tilburg says.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you could study the art of conversation. Things like your job or your past-times will matter very little if you fail to create a meaningful dialogue. &ldquo;Bores talk a lot, but they have very little to say,&rdquo; says Van Tilburg. Feel free to express your own opinions, but make sure you give the other person plenty of opportunity to express theirs, too &ndash; and be sure to ask lots of questions that draw the other person out of themselves. With time, your new acquaintance may forget all about their preconceptions.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf none of this works, then don&rsquo;t take it too personally. Van Tilburg points out that people are much more likely to apply negative stereotypes to others when they feel threatened. By judging you unfairly harshly for your job or your hobbies, someone may just be covering up their insecurities. Boringness, like beauty, lies in the mind of the beholder.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDavid Robson is an award-winning science writer and author of \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdavidrobson.me\u002Fthe-expectation-effect\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E, published by Canongate (UK) and Henry Holt (USA) in early 2022.

They did not seem to recognise how much they had relied on the &lsquo;cheat sheet&rsquo;, however &ndash; since they predicted that they would do equally well on a second test featuring another hundred questions, without the answer key.

As hoped, they reported feeling a greater connection to their future self, and in subsequent measures of decision making, they showed more financial responsibility. They reported being more likely to set aside money for retirement, for example. Many photo editing apps already allow you to prematurely age your selfies, and this kind of technology could be incorporated into educational programs that encourage people to think more carefully about their future wellbeing.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a low-tech intervention, you might consider a simple imaginative exercise &ndash; in which you write a letter to yourself 20 years from now, describing what is most important for you now and your plans for the coming decades. Like the sight of the aged avatars, this encourages people to feel a greater sense of connection with their future self &ndash; and, as a result, primes them for positive behavioural change. Hershfield&rsquo;s studies have shown that \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdoi.org\u002F10.1037\u002Fxap0000153\"\u003Ethe task increased the amount of time that people spent exercising\u003C\u002Fa\u003E over the following week &ndash; a sign that they had started to take their long-term health seriously.

When dealing with the stresses and frustration of parenting, for example, he tries to put himself in the shoes of his future self to imagine how he might look back on his own behaviour. &ldquo;I try to think whether he would be proud of the way that I handled myself,&rdquo; he says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might seem eccentric to start a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; with an imagined entity &ndash; but once your future self becomes alive in your mind, you may find it much easier to make the small personal sacrifices that are essential to preserve your wellbeing.

The multiple burdens that suppress women&rsquo;s achievements won&rsquo;t ease until men take on a greater share of domestic and caring responsibilities, and also become more likely to downsize or adjust their own hours when family circumstances change. But this is challenging in practice.

During much of lockdown she had to move her shop from bricks-and-mortar to online, but sales haven&rsquo;t suffered hugely. Crucially, she says, she and her husband have been equally dividing domestic tasks and care of their four-year-old son. As he works for a bank and has a more rigid schedule even though he&rsquo;s working from home, he&rsquo;s been taking on the evening shift of cooking dinner and caring for their son, as well as helping her reopen the shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe period of temporary &ndash; though hectic &ndash; flexibility for the self-employed Stirling-Baker allowed her to reorient her business and buffer the unpredictability of her son&rsquo;s new life.

It helped that she could compensate for her husband&rsquo;s strict schedule by making her own hours, but that can&rsquo;t continue once the shop is running normally. And the hard work is taking a toll. Stirling-Baker hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping much, she acknowledges, and is focused on the crucial Christmas period for retail sales, while trying not to think too much on the uncertain period beyond that.\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShort-term solutions\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are, of course, things that employers can do to incorporate flexibility and help ease the impact of the pandemic recession on women.

This would help relieve the exhaustion that&rsquo;s particularly affecting certain groups of women (although companies that are already crunched may find it hard to be generous).

According to Mich&egrave;le Tertilt, a family economist at the University of Mannheim in Germany, the measure that would help more than any other in curbing the shecession is reopening schools &ndash; especially for the young children whose care is so demanding. As Hegewisch comments, &ldquo;What the crisis has shown is that [telework] will only work if the childcare and education infrastructure is there. I always go through the roof when I see these [images of] glorious days of working from home and you have this dad sitting in front of his computer with a toddler on his knee.

In addition to shutting many childcare facilities, the pandemic may shift demand for care away from big facilities to small, neighbourhood-level providers, sometimes operating from their homes. Local businesses are more attractive when people are being encouraged to stay put, and small providers can more easily reduce the numbers of people mixing.
